# cli-nception

A CLI CLI.

## TLDR

I use Arch (BTW) and I don't like GUIs, so my system is CLI-based. However, I
often spend stretches of time using a Windows machine for gaming or a macOS
machine for music production. Sometimes, I'll be away long enough that I forget
lesser-used operations' commands or which package manages them. Maybe a declarative
CLI for my CLI will help my immediate need for help recalling operation commands/packages
and extend to follow me across machines and operating systems.
